# Emoji Generator from Facial Expressions
A Deep Learning-based AI model that detects facial expressions and generates matching emojis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras.

# Project Overview
This project uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize facial expressions and generate the corresponding emoji. The system captures a userâ€™s face, analyzes their emotion, and maps it to an appropriate emoji, enhancing human-computer interaction in applications like chatbots, social media, and assistive technology.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Model Architecture: CNN with BatchNormalization, Dropout, MaxPooling
Dataset: Facial expression dataset (7 classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise)
Optimization: Adam Optimizer, Precision & Recall metrics

# Features
Detects 7 different facial expressions.
Generates and displays real-time matching emojis.
Uses OpenCV for face detection and preprocessing.
Trained on a large dataset for accurate recognition.
It can be extended for social media filters and assistive tools.

# Future Improvements
Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset
Deploy as a Flask API for real-time web integration
Add support for more diverse facial expressions
